## Productivity Porn

If you're a type A person, there is a very high chance that you have fallen victim to productivity porn and the notion industrial complex.

Productivity porn is the act of constantly indulging into activities that give you the illusion of being productive instead of actually getting anything done.

The perfect example of this is watching hours of videos on how to be productive. Another one is spending too much time on building the perfect productivity setup.

It's very similar to the tutorial hell we talk about in tech, but for your overall tasks and productivity. It also extends to watching too many motivational vidoes and reading too many self-help books.

## Notion Industrial Complex

> The industrial complex is a socioeconomic concept wherein businesses become entwined in social or political systems or institutions, creating or bolstering a profit economy from these systems

You might think I am crazy to call the whole notion cult an industrial complex. But I think it's pretty close to one.

- Notion started off as a modern take on word documents, and the personal productivity space loved it, it was almost like you could build your own app to manage all your notes, link them in all the fancy ways, build dashboard pages and so on.
- Notion seems to be going after the google workspace business these days with the notion calendar and all the other acquisitions.

But this is not about them as a company or their tech, it's a very impressive product. This is about notion's role in personal productivity, and their cultural presence in this space.

Productivity porn and Notion are a match made in heaven. I like to call it the Notion Industrial Complex.

Two schools of thought - notion and hyper optimising the flow of information around your tasks // kepano and the obsidian school of thought

I started using notion when it was in beta, I use it on my day job, but I don't use it anymore for my managing my personal notes and tasks anymore, I have moved to a radically simpler setup to just use obsidian and todoist.

I was a part of the notion industrial complex, I always thought that I want just another notion re-org away from hitting my perfect productivity setup, and I used to spend hours making my notion pretty and organised. I used to religiously follow creators on yt that would keep coming up with new videos of elaborate setups to organise notes, projects, goals, tasks, milestones, reminders. 

It is very easy to fall prey to all this and forget that the whole point of this system is just one thing, that you are supposed to close more tasks. Anything that gets in the way of you starting 

## Signal Density over Illusionary Metadata

One of my managers told our team a very beautiful line "Stop Starting and Start Closing". And I have taken this line to heart when it comes to productivity and output in general. The only way to perform is to pick a few tasks every day and lock-in until you close them. Rather than keep building elaborate information hierarchies of things you're supposed to do, doing, and have done.

Action creates information. Motion causes motivation. You don't have to build perfect systems that capture all kinds of metadata about your tasks so you can keep feeling good about how you are making informed decisions about your tasks. The act of setting up something that capture so much metadata effectively is taking up time that can be spent on actually working on things and will give you more actionable singal-dense data about whatever you're trying to do.

Move towards more signal-dense info about your tasks, rather than illusionary metadata that looks pretty in a system. And if you're one of those people who is creating a pretty notion to post about it on pintrest or tiktok, please stop reading this, you are too deep in the notion industrial complex.
