Approach life like every problem arises from a skill issue. 

- Can't get a job ? skill issue. 
- Can't lose weight ? skill issue. 
- Can't hit your reading goal ? skill issue. 
- Can't hit your FTP ? skill issue. 

Marking almost everything as a skill issue turns the problem from rigid to malleable. It flips the narrative from "oh fuck I have this problem" to "what can I do to make progress"

It encourages improving things, it encourages action. Else the very first reaction in the face of a problem is sulking, or feeling the strain of having a problem.

Or at the very least it makes you delusional enough to think that you can fix this problem, and most of the time that is all you need.

Approaching everything as a skill issue leads to this mamba mentality that you can learn almost anything. You shed all biases and labels that you have attached to yourself and move ahead to try and solve the problem.

What a beautiful psyop meme. Everything is a skill issue.
