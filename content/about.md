üëãüèª Hi, I'm Junaid.

**Building robust data infrastructure and crafting elegant solutions to complex problems.**

I currently live in Bengaluru working remotely as a software engineer at [Atlan](https://atlan.com/) -- a collaborative platform for modern data teams. I'm passionate about systems programming, distributed computing, and creating tools that empower developers.

## Work

I joined [Atlan](https://atlan.com/) in June 2021 as an intern towards the end of my second year of college. It was remote so I could manage it with my "online" college during the covid lockdown.

Since joining, most of my work has primarily been towards building the connector platform and developing the initial set of connectors for BI and SQL tools. These connectors are data pipelines built using:
- **Argo Workflows** for orchestration
- **JDBC** for database connectivity
- **Python** for data transformation and processing
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration
- **Docker** for containerization

I'm deeply interested in all things systems programming -- database internals, distributed systems, PL theory, compilers, containers and Kubernetes. I love technical writing as well, and I drive a lot of engineering documentation initiatives at work.

## Skills & Technologies

### Languages
Python, Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, Bash

### Technologies & Tools
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, Argo Workflows, AWS, Terraform
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Data Engineering**: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, ETL/ELT pipelines
- **Development**: Git, CI/CD, REST APIs, GraphQL, gRPC

### Areas of Expertise
- Distributed Systems Design
- Data Pipeline Architecture
- Container Orchestration
- Technical Documentation
- System Performance Optimization

## Notable Projects & Achievements

- **Connector Platform Architecture**: Designed and implemented a scalable connector framework that powers 50+ integrations at Atlan, handling millions of metadata operations daily
- **Open Source Contributions**: Active contributor to various data engineering tools and Kubernetes operators
- **Technical Writing**: Published internal engineering guides that became the standard reference for the team's development practices
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced connector pipeline execution time by 60% through strategic caching and parallel processing improvements
