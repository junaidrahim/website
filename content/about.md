üëãüèª Hi, I‚Äôm Junaid.

I'm a systems engineer based in Bengaluru, currently building the future of agentic data collaboration at [Atlan](https://atlan.com/).

My work sits at the intersection of distributed systems, developer experience, and AI-native engineering.

I try to build systems that are both technically excellent and deeply human-centered.

Whether I'm architecting metadata pipelines, designing developer workflows, or documenting complex systems, I approach problems with systematic thinking while maintaining focus on the people who'll use what I build, be it humans or agents.

## Work

I wear multiple hats at Atlan. My work spans the following domains:

**Platform Engineering**

My primary focus right now is on the Atlan App Framework that enables our customers, forward-deployed and internal engineering teams to build on top of the Atlan platform faster and better.

**Data Engineering**

I've worked on a lot of metadata pipelines for BI and SQL tools using Argo Workflows, JDBC, and Python.

**Developer Experience**

I really enjoy working in problems that require developer empathy. I work on a lot of internal projects around documentation and tooling that empower other engineers to build faster and better.

**AI-Native Engineering**

I'm super interested in figuring out ecosystem investments that help engineers ship faster with LLMs and tools like Cursor and Claude Code.

I'm deeply interested in all things around systems programming -- database internals, distributed systems, PL theory, compilers, containers and kubernetes. I love technical writing as well.

## Not Work

On weekends you'll find me [reading in cubbon park](https://www.instagram.com/cubbonreads/), [doing bike rides](https://www.corner.inc/list/db4aac10-9f0e-461b-bf00-2d785b387bf0) or [cycling across bangalore](https://www.strava.com/athletes/50189743).
