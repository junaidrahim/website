Delivered a talk at ArgoCon 2023 hosted w/ KubeCon Europe 2023 in Amsterdam about a tool we built at Atlan to make our lives a little easier when it came to managing our templates in Argo Workflows ‚ö°Ô∏è

The title of the talk was "Shipping Argo Workflows in Packages üì¶", introducing argopm - a package manager for argo.

If you're someone who manages a lot of workflow templates and other argo resources and would like a solution that would help you publish and distribute these resources just like packages with dependencies, argopm can help.
