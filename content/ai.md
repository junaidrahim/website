All the ideas, arguments and opinions on this site are mine. The thinking is mine. The mistakes are mine too.

I use AI tools extensively in my writing process. Editing, restructuring, catching errors, tightening prose. If you've read something here that flows well, there's a good chance an LLM helped me get it there. But the core of every piece, what I'm trying to say and why, that's always me.

I think of it the same way I think about agents and code. The hard part was never the typing. The hard part is knowing what to build and why. Same with writing. The hard part is having something worth saying.

**Things I use AI for on this site:**
- Editing and proofreading drafts
- Restructuring narrative flow
- Editorial feedback on tone and clarity
- Minor site maintenance

**Things I don't use AI for:**
- Generating ideas or opinions
- Writing drafts from scratch
- Deciding what's worth writing about
