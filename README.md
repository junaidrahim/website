# website

This is my website. 

I'm not trying to build a brand. I'm not trying to sell anything. I'm just trying to write.

I own the domain, I control the content and the distribution, and if I want to write a 3000-word essay about fountain pens or why most engineers are just code monkeys, I can do that without some algorithm deciding whether it's "engaging" enough.


This repository contains posts about whatever I'm thinking about. Technical deep-dives. Rants about the industry. Stories from internships. Thoughts on tools and workflows. 

I really don't want to be a content-generating NPC.

Real vulnerable thoughts, not LinkedIn-optimized personal brand garbage.

In 20 years, X might be dead, Medium might pivot to become something else, but I'll still be here trying to write and make sense of the world and my industry.

This domain, these files, this markdown - they'll still work in any browser on any device. That's the beauty of the files on the web: it's built on open standards, not platform lock-in.

Static sites are punk rock. Platforms are corporate rock.
