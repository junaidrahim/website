I'm currently working as a swe at [Atlan](https://atlan.com) building systems and data pipelines. 

Living in Bengaluru, India.

This website is a record of my work, talks, projects, musings and research.

In my free time I love to read, write, cycle, travel and go on bike rides. I'm weirdly nerdy about PKM systems, fountain pens and cameras.

I've written a longer introduction [here](/about) if you're interested :)
