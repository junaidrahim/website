This website is an archive of my thoughts, musings, projects, and research.

Apart from work, I love writing, cycling, swimming and traveling. I am a huge nerd about PKM systems, hmu if you need app suggestions.

I simp for long form content, I try to spend a lot of time with podcasts, well-filmed yt vids, books, pdfs and my RSS feed. I love reading/listening about psychology, history, society, tech, design and economics.

You can find me on twitter [@junaidrahxm](https://twitter.com/junaidrahxm)
