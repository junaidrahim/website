Just another [hacker](https://phrack.org/issues/7/3).

I'm currently working as a systems engineer at [Atlan](https://atlan.com) building the future of agentic data collaboration. 

Living in Bengaluru, India.

This website is a record of my work, talks, projects, musings, curiosities and research.

In my free time I love to write, read, cycle, travel and go on bike rides. I'm weirdly nerdy about PKM systems, fountain pens and street photography.

I've written a longer introduction [here](/about) if you're interested :)
